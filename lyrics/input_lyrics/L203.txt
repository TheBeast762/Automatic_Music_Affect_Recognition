Everywhere I look, I see her smile
Her absent minded eyes
And she has kept me wonderin' for so long
How this thing could go wrong

It seems to me that we are both the same
Playin' the same game
But as darkness falls this true love falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart

She's so vulnerable like China in my hands
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
I could never hurt the one I love, she's all I've got
But she's so vulnerable, oh, so vulnerable

Days like these no one should be alone
No heart should hide away
Her touch is gently conquering my mind
There's nothin' words can say

She's colored all the secrets of my soul
I've whispered all my dreams
But just as night time falls this vision falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart, yeah

She's so vulnerable like China in my hands
(She's so vulnerable)
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
(Oh, so vulnerable)
I could never hurt someone I love, she's all I've got
But she's so vulnerable, oh, so vulnerable, yeah

Don't hide your eyes

She's so vulnerable like China in my hands
(She's so vulnerable)
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
(Oh, so vulnerable)
I could never hurt the one I love, she's all I've got

But she's so vulnerable like China in my hands
(She's so vulnerable)
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
(Oh, so vulnerable)
I could never hurt some one I love, she's all I've got
She's so vulnerable, oh, so vulnerable, yeah

She's so vulnerable
(My baby, she's so vulnerable)
She's so vulnerable, oh yeah
Oh, so vulnerable

(She's all I've got)
She's so vulnerable
She's so vulnerable
Oh, so vulnerable
