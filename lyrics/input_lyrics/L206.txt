I met a girl at the carnival
In Rio de Janeiro
We danced all night on the boulevard
In doorways we did the tango

I miss her lips and the way she sashayed her hips
As she shook her shoulders
I miss the smell of her hair, I don't care
If it takes my whole life to find her

We were dancing in the summer rain
We were dancing through the night
I never knew her real name
So I called her Spanish Eyes
Spanish Eyes

The sun came up and the girl was gone
Her masquerade was over
I searched the streets drunk with love
But no one seemed to know her

I miss the touch of her body so much
I long for the warmth inside her
Somewhere in time she will come back to me
And I'll spend my whole life beside her

We were dancing in the summer rain
We were dancing through the night
I never knew her real name
So I called her Spanish Eyes

I miss her lips and the way she sashayed her hips
As she shook her shoulders
I miss the smell of her hair, I don't care
If it takes my whole life to find her

We were dancing in the summer rain
We were dancing through the night
I never knew her real name
So I called her Spanish Eyes

We were dancing in the summer rain
We were dancing through the night
I never knew her real name
So I called her Spanish Eyes
Spanish Eyes
Spanish Eyes
