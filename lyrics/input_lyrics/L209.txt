Come step inside my hate you know there's nothing to it
Step inside my pain you'll never make it through it
Once you're sucked into my sado-paradise
Lose your mind inside the pleasure lies within your pain, pain

Drown in my hate you know, you know brutality's the way of this world
Branded and scarred defy, defy a comatose and blind existence
Hatred holocaust you see in me it's more than just a way of life
I've re-invented the way, I relate to this complacent world

All of life decays rapes my eyes
Screams never silence the pain
Death is like an old friend
I can't wait to watch you die

I am you vice so real, so real desires of the scars of new flesh
Bathe in you blood excites incites the ritualistic lacerations
Inhumanities profane, insane inflicted since the dawn of time
Make your peace with God divine and embrace the pain
That burns inside you

All of life decays rapes my eyes
Screams never silence the pain
Death is like an old friend
I can't wait to watch you die, I can't wait

Come step inside my hate you know there's nothing to it
Step inside my pain you'll never make it through it
Redefine your life in sado-paradise
Necessary cleansing of the mind's eye

Love and agony electric ecstasy
Can't get enough euphoric serenity
Stains won't fade away forever scarstruck
They never fade away forever scarstruck

Drown in my hate you know, you know brutality's the way of this world
Branded and scarred defy, defy a comatose and blind existence
Your like the walking dead so blind inside oblivious to psycho pleasure
I am your new God ungod so if you want hell here I am

Everything around me decays rapes my eyes
Screams never silence the pain
Make you my canvas of pure, fresh, flesh
Scarstruck, scarstruck, scarstruck
