Where do you go when your luck runs out
Yeah, where do you go
Where do you go now
And where do you go when you feel like crying
Where do you go
Where do you go now

Won't you come inside with me today
You could stay inside with me today
Can't you see it's gonna rain

And how do you feel when the lights go out
How do you feel
How do you feel alone
And how do you feel when there's no one there
On the other end of the phone

Won't you come inside with me today
You just stay inside with me today
Can't you see it's gonna rain
Yeah, can't you see it's gonna rain
Yeah, it's gonna rain

And don't you wanna get warm
And don't you wanna get dry
And don't you wanna stay
Can't you see it's gonna rain

So won't you come inside with me today
Cause I can see it's gonna rain
Yeah, I can see it's gonna rain
Can't you see it's gonna rain
Oh, I can see it's gonna rain
