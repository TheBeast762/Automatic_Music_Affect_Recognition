sunday gloom hour slumberless dearest shadow live number little white flower never awake black coach sorrow take angel think ever returning will angry think join you  gloom sunday  gloom sunday shadow spend heart decide end soon therell candle prayer say know let weep let know im glad go dead dream dead im caress last breath soul ill bless  gloom sunday  dreaming dreaming wake find sleep deep heart dear darling hope dream never haunted heart tell much wanted gloom sunday
