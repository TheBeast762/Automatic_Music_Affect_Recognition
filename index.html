<p>This term, I would like you to make use of an installation of
the <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> system for your
team website.  You will receive, by e-mail, a username and account
for this site.  To access the account, use the URI
<a href="https://sis.cs.fsu.edu/trac/">https://sis.cs.fsu.edu/trac/</a>,
and then select the name of your team.  The Trac site contains on-line
help, which should be sufficient for you to figure out how to use it.</p> 

<p>Your team will need to maintaint two areas: one public
(accessible to the entire class) and one private (accessible only
to your team members and the intructors and graders).  Team
deliverables will initially be places in the private area, and
then latter will be made accessible in the public area.
</p>

<p>This page is an example of how the home page of your public
area might look if we were not using Trac this term.  However,
since we are using Trac, you should simply enter the data in your
team's Trac page.  For example <a href="https://sis.cs.fsu.edu/trac/axolotl">https://sis.cs.fsu.edu/trac/axolotl</a>.</p>

<p>Your public (Trac) page should include, as Wiki text and Wiki
file attachments, the content that you want to share with the
class.  It should also provide links to the password-protected
locations where private information, including embargoed
deliverables, may be found.</p>

<p>If I have not made any errors in configuring the sis.cs.fsu.edu system,
the following should be true:</p>
<ul>

<li>When you first visit https://sis.cs.fsu.edu with any browser, it will complain about the website's
security certificate.  You will need to agee to accept the (self-signed) certificate.</li>

<li>The https://sis.cs.fsu.edu/trac/* pages should not be readable without providing 
a username and password.  The username will be the same as the one that
you use for shell.cs.fsu.edu, but the password will be a randomly assigned string
that will be sent to by e-mail.</li>

<li>Once logged in, you should be able to read the Wiki of each team.</li>

<li>You should be able to modify only the Wiki of your own team.</li>

<li>You should be able to log into sis.cs.fsu.edu using ssh, using the same username and
password, but if you use "passwd" to change the password it will only change the
shell login password.  The HTTP password (used by Trac) will be unchanged.</li>

<li>You should be able to access your team's shared home directory,
whose pathname is of the form "/back1/home/axolotl/public_html", with your team-name
in place of "axolotl".  That directory is exported as "https://sis.cs.fsu.edu/~axolotl",
with your team-name substituted for "axolotl".  This should only be accessible to
members of this class who have logged in using their HTTP username and password.
You can modify the index.html file
and link in other files, to publish information to the whole class.  However, take care to first use "newgrp" to change
your working group name to your team-name (e.g., "newgrp axolotl"), and use
"chmod" to set group write permissions on the files, or else your team-mates
will not be able to modify them.</li>

<li>There is a subdirectory with a pathname of the form "/back1/home/axolotl/public_html/private",
which is exported only to members of your group who have logged in, and the
instructors. You can use this to post things you want to share within the
group and with the instructors, like team deliverables that need to be graded. Take
care with the group ownership and permissions, as mentioned above.</li>

<li>Eventually, we will have some form of version control set up,
either CVS, SVN, or Git. I have not yet decided which one to use.
Git is the best but hardest to learn; Subversion is next best, and slightly
easier to learn; CVS is the simplest, but less convenient and less flexible.
Each of them has some support in Eclipse, but the degree of maturity of
the support there is greatest with CVS (oldest), next with Subversion (next oldest),
and least mature with Git.</li>

</ul>

<p>See the <a href="../assign/deliverables.html">deliverables
instructions</a> for what is to be posted on the web page at each
delivery, and the course <a href="../../calendar.html">Calendar</a> for the deadlines by which
you are expected to have each deliverable on line and ready to be
graded.</p>

<p>Take care to have an up-to-date copy of each deliverable
document on line by the deadline.  Place a link to it from your
(public) Trac project home page, but place the deliverable itself
in a private location, that only your team members and the
instructors can access. The private area is:
</p><ul>
<li>via ssh to sis.cs.fsu.edu, /back1/home/&lt;teamname&gt;/public_html/private</li>
<li>via browser: https://sis.cs.fsu.edu/~&lt;teamname&gt;/private/</li>
</ul>

<p>As each deliverable comes due, you will be asked to move
the previous deliverables to a public area.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to keep all the documents your team is
working on continually as nearly up-to-date as is practicable, so
that you don't have to do a lot of work just before the
deliverable dates.  In particular, you are encouraged to work
ahead and post drafts in advance of the deliverable dates.</p>

<p>In addition to the public deliverables listed on the left, 
each team member is required to turn an <em>individual</em>
team evaluation form in to the instructor periodically. Use
the following template and instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peer Evaluation Form template
(<a href="PeerEvaluationTemplate.html">.html</a>)
(<a href="PeerEvaluationTemplate.doc">.doc</a>)
</li>
<li><a href="PeerEvaluationInstructions.html"> 
   Peer Evaluation Form instructions</a></li>
</ul>
